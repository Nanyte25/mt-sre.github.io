## Addon SRE Acceptance Criteria checklist

The Service Owners, with the assistance of the Addon SRE team,
will deploy the service to production while the SLOs are being
implemented and fine-tuned. The Addon SRE onboarding team will
work through the
[Addon SRE Acceptance Criteria Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c0drua0YciULkEuYsTCAM1E_JJK-b2TgjTeFnjxh_6c/edit)
process.

## Additional Requirements

There are also requirements from other teams, which can be found [here](../release-process/gating_for_prod.md).

## Next Steps

If all requirements are passed successfully, the service owners will be allowed to
deploy to production. Once the service is running in production, the service can
begin its transition period. This is where an addon proves its stability for a given
amount of time and then the pager is handed over to the SRE team. Read more about
the transition period [here](pager-handover.md).
