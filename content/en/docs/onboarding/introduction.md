The Repeatable Onboarding for Managed Services (ROMS) article on [source](https://source.redhat.com/communities/communities_of_practice/cross_cutting_co/cloud_services_cop/wiki/draft_how_to_get_started_with_roms_repeatable_onboarding_for_managed_services)
has a great introduction to managed services.

There are multiple steps to onboard a managed service:

1. First the [ROMS](roms.md) process needs to be completed.
2. Then the [onboardig acceptance criteria checklist](acceptance-criteria-checklist.md)
has to be completed, along with other requirements, to onboard the addon to production.
3. The addon must then pass a [soak test](soak-test.md).
4. The addon then has to run in production for a given amount of time to prove its
stability, and then the pager can be handed over. See the
[pager handover](pager-handover.md) section for more information.
